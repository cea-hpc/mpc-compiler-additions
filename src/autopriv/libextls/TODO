###### TO DO #####
- Add locks to protect "optim tls" from possible reallocation (rw-locks)
- Add dlsym() handle through "optim TLS" indirection table
- Remove test code inside extls_generic_tls_get_addr() once merged
- Some troubles when compiling with NDEBUG (Werror + Wextra)
- Adding new architecture support in "optim_tls.c"
- Consider the implementation of _tls_get_addr w/ one or two GOT entries (tls_index or module & offset)
- Remove pragma weak in "optim_tls.c", MPC-specific

###### NEXT MILESTONE ######
- Adding HLS support
- Merge the lib inside thread library (MPC)
